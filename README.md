# RPKI History

An API to query historical RPKI data, more specifically, Validated ROA Payloads (VRPs).

* [API](https://www.ihr.live/rpki-history/api/)

We obtain VRP data from the [RPKI Views](https://www.rpkiviews.org/) project and store
it in a compact form for fast access. From each dump we extract the
`output/rpki-client.csv` file, which contains just the VRPs, and update our database.

A VRP entry consists of five fields:

```csv
ASN,IP Prefix,Max Length,Trust Anchor,Expires
AS13335,1.0.0.0/24,24,apnic,1753280249
```

We ignore the expiry time and only work on dump-time granularity. For each ingested dump
we compare the set of VRPs (in form of `asn, prefix, max_length`) with the previous
dump. Each VRP has a `visible` time range, during which is was continuously visible.
Since most VRPs are stable, this allows us to update just the time range, keeping the
database size compact.

Data limitations:

* **High-frequency updates are invisible.** Currently, dumps are created roughly
every 20 minutes. If a VRP expires / is removed and potentially recreated between dumps,
this will not be reflected in the database.

* **Data is at dump-time granularity.** If a VRP is created, expires, or is removed
between dumps, the exact point in time is lost. For example, if there are two dumps at
time `A` and `C`, a VRP expires at time `B` (`A < B < C`), and a user queries for
timestamp `D` (`A < D < B`) then the query will not find the VRP, since its visibility
ended at `A`. Similarly, VRPs that are only visible in one dump will have equal values
for the start and end visibility time.

* **Queryable time range is limited.** Naturally, we are limited by the amount of
available data. Trying queries outside of the available time range will result in an
error (to distinguish from non-existent VRPs).

## Endpoints

### `/vrp`

Returns the list of covering VRPs for a prefix at a specific time, time range, or at the
latest dump time if no time parameter is specified.

#### Parameters

Mandatory:

* `prefix`: The prefix for which to return covering VRPs.

There are two types of time parameters, which are mutually exclusive: Point-in-time and
time range. For a time range only one bound can be specified, in which case the returned
list will include *all* earlier/later data available.

Point-in-time:

* `timestamp`: The timestamp (in `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` [assumes UTC] or unix
epoch format) for which to return VRPs.

Time range:

* `timestamp__gte`: The start of the time range (inclusive; in
  `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`[assumes UTC] or unix epoch format)
  for which to return VRPs.
* `timestamp__lte`: The end of the time range (inclusive; in `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`
  [assumes UTC] or unix epoch format) for which to return VRPs.

#### Result Format

```json
// https://www.ihr.live/rpki-history/api/vrp?prefix=8.8.8.0/24
[
  {
    "prefix": "8.8.8.0/24",
    "asn": 15169,
    "max_length": 24,
    "visible": {
      "from": "2023-12-29T17:30:54+00:00",
      "to": "2025-08-13T06:29:10+00:00"
    }
  }
]
```

`visible` refers to the timespan during which the VRP was *continuously* visible, i.e.,
present in the dumps. Thus, if a VRP is missing from a dump, a new entry with a separate
`visible` range is created. **This time is unrelated to the validity time (`Not
before`/`Not after`) of the ROA!**

### `/status`

Returns the RPKI status for the specified prefix/ASN combination at the specified time,
or at the latest dump time if no timestamp is specified.

#### Parameters

Mandatory:

* `prefix`: The prefix to be checked.
* `asn`: The origin ASN of the prefix.

Optional:

* `timestamp`: The timestamp (in `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` [assumes UTC] or unix epoch format)
for which to check the status. If omitted, use the latest available dump time.

#### Result Format

```json
// https://www.ihr.live/rpki-history/api/status?prefix=8.8.8.0/24&asn=15169
{
  "status": "Valid"
}

// https://www.ihr.live/rpki-history/api/status?prefix=8.8.8.0/25&asn=15169
{
  "status": "Invalid",
  "reason": {
    "code": "moreSpecific",
    "description": "Covering VRP with matching origin ASN found, but queried prefix is more specific than maxLength attribute allows."
  }
}
```

`status` is one of `[Valid, Invalid, NotFound]`.

`reason` (only for `Invalid` status) gives more detailed information about why the
status is invalid. `code` is for automatic processing, while `description` provides a
human-readable explanation.

### `/metadata`

Returns the list of dumps contained in the database. Since this list is very long, this
endpoint is paginated and returns at most 10000 results per page.

#### Parameters

Mandatory: None

Optional:

* `timestamp__gte`: The start of the time range (inclusive; in
  `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`[assumes UTC] or unix epoch format)
  for which to return data.
* `timestamp__lte`: The end of the time range (inclusive; in `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` [assumes UTC] or unix epoch format) for which to return data.
* `page`: The page number to load (defaults to 1).
* `page_size`: The number of results to include in one page (defaults to 10000).

#### Result Format

```json
// https://www.ihr.live/rpki-history/api/metadata
{
  "next": "https://www.ihr.live/rpki-history/api/metadata?page_size=1000&page=2",
  "results": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2020-12-06T16:37:23+00:00",
      "deleted_vrps": 0,
      "unchanged_vrps": 0,
      "new_vrps": 205850
    },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

`next` is the URL to the next page. It will be an empty string if there are no results
left.

`timestamp` refers to the dump time (taken from the filename).

`[deleted|updated|new]_vrps` indicates the number of VRPs differing from the previous
dump. Note that `deleted` refers to a VRP that was present in the previous dump, but not
in the current one.

## Database Dump

For easier analysis of the dataset, or self-hosting, [a dump of the database (updated
weekly) is available.](https://archive.ihr.live/ihr/rpki-history/)

## Self-hosting

If for some reason you want to host your own version of this page, here is how.

### Getting Started

Create secrets files containing the Postgres user passwords.

```bash
# For normal user
touch ./secrets/postgres-pw.txt
# For read-only user
touch ./secrets/postgres-ro-pw.txt
# Of course write actual passwords to these files...
```

Initialize database. This will also build the initial Docker image, which might take
some time.

```bash
docker compose run --rm init-db
```

**Optional:** Restore database dump.

```bash
docker compose exec -T database pg_restore -d rpki_history < rpki-history.dump
```

**Optional (but recommended):** Create an index over the prefix column to greatly
decrease query time. This is not built into the init-db script, since it is faster to
build the index once after all data was imported.

```bash
docker compose exec database psql -c "CREATE INDEX ON vrps USING gist (prefix inet_ops)"
```

Start the API server.

```bash
docker compose up -d api
```

### Updating the Data

To import the latest available data (uses RPKIViews by default):

```bash
docker compose run --rm update-db
```

For more usage options (e.g., importing a specific timestamp):

```bash
docker compose run --rm update-db --help
```

### Backup/restore Database

#### Backup

```bash
docker compose exec database pg_dump --data-only -Fc > rpki-history.dump
```

#### Restore

Assumes fresh install or that `postgres_data` volume was deleted.

```bash
# Reinitialize database to create schema *and additional user*.
docker compose run --rm init-db
# Restore data
docker compose exec -T database pg_restore -d rpki_history < rpki-history.dump
```
